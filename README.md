## Description

This web page is my second webpage. Even though it's technically not the second webpage I've _created_ it is certainly the second webpage I've intentionally made without floundering in the dark and abandoning it altogether. I hope with this webpage, I am able to practice the things I've been wrestling to understand the past three days at Epicodus.
