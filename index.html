  <h1>What did I have for breakfast this morning?</h1>
  <p>I had tofu and miso soup, with a bowl of rice and seaweed. It's easy on the stomach and super tasty in the morning. Plus, it's wicked fast, so I can get a little extra sleep</p>
  <h1>What am I watching?</h1>
  <p>It is currently the month of October. So any movie that's not a horror movie is illegal! Many people think they don't like the horror genre, because they don't like being scared. However there are all sorts of horror films. Funny ones, ones for kids, outdated ones, just slightly spooky ones, etc.</p>
