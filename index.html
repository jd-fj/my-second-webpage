  <div class="Breakfast">
    <h1>What did I have for breakfast this morning?</h1>
    <p>I had tofu and miso soup, with a bowl of rice and seaweed. It's easy on the stomach and super tasty in the morning. Plus, it's <span class="highlight">wicked fast</span>, so I can get a little extra sleep</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="Movies">
    <h1>What am I watching?</h1>
    <p>It is currently the month of October. So any movie that's not a horror movie is illegal! Many people think they don't like the horror genre, because they don't like being scared. However there are all sorts of horror films. Funny ones, ones for kids, outdated ones, just slightly spooky ones, etc.</p>
<!-- Images of Young Frankenstein and Dracula Dead and Loving It-->
    <img src="img/YF.jpg" alt="Young Frankenstein">
    <p>One of my family favorites that we can all watch and enjoy together without triggering one another is Young Frankenstein. If you're a fan of Mel Brooks, you can't miss this one. Plus, Gene Wilder is one of my favorite actors. You can tell everyone making comedy horror films is having a blast, Young Frankenstein no exception.</p>

    <img src="img/DDL.jpg" alt="Dracula Dead and Loving It">
    <p>Another silly Mel Brooks movie, Dracula Dead and Loving It is not as commonly known as Young Frankenstein. Brooks' take on the infamous Bram Stoker narrative is just as comical. It's the kind of movie I can watch every year and still spit my drink out lauging.</p>
